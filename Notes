Song
#artist=

invokes Artist#add_song to add itself to the artist's collection of songs


#initialize
invokes #artist= instead of simply assigning to an @artist instance
variable to ensure that associations are created upon initialization (FAILED -

#initialize can be invoked with an
optional third argument, a Genre object to be assigned to the song's
'genre'property (song belongs to genre)

**add_song is broken ## It's producing strings, not instances ##
def add_song(song)
  if song.artist == nil
    song.artist = self
    @songs << song
  else
    nil
  end
  song
end

- does the song exist as an instance? If not, create it, assign the artist/genre, and scoop up
- if yes, and it does not have an artist assigned, assign the artist/genre, then scoop up
- if yes, but already has an artist/genre, just scoop up
