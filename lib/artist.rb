  # Artist.find_or_create_by_name(name)
  # This class method should take the name that is passed in (remember, it will be a string), and do one of two things. Find the artist instance that has that name or create one if it doesn't exist. Either way, the return value of the method will be an instance of an artist with the name attribute filled out.
  #
  # Artist#add_song(song)
  # This instance method exists to tell the artist about its songs.
  # Simply take the Song instance that is passed in as an argument and store it in a songs array with all the other songs that belong to the artist.
