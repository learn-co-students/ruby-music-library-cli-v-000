# ...but this lab wants us to use a Concearns:Findable...so we'll copy & paste this into that.
#module Findable
#  def find_by_name(name)
    # This is not part of the lab tests; I'm doing this to explore extended functonality
    # self.all.detect {|x| x.name == name} #=> this works but returns nil if the name isn't there.
#    if (self.all.detect {|x| x.name == name}) == nil
#      puts "The name #{name} is not in the #{self} records"
#    else
#      self.all.detect {|x| x.name == name}
#    end
#  end
#end
