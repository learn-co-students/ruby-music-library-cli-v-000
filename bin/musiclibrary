MusicLibraryController.new.call

### NOTE : Need to check/fix the musicimporter "import" split for the specs vs running the program


#temp = MusicLibraryController.new("./spec/fixtures/mp3s")
# temp.list_songs
# # temp.list_artists
# # temp.list_genres
# # temp.list_songs_by_artist
# # temp.list_songs_by_genre
# temp.play_song


##ISSUES OCCURRING...
# rspec spec/004_songs_and_artists_spec.rb --> "Artist=" not working
# rspec spec/006_artists_and_genres_spec.rb --> "#genres" not working (was working before - probably the "Songs class genre= method screwing it up")

## Testing
# ruby bin/musiclibrary
