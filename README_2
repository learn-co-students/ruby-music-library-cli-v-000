nouns and pronouns =
are objects

1. Identify your objects ( write a story )
I want to build
an app that can load
artists, songs, and
genres and for each of them
it can generate a index.html
that lists all of the
items in the collection
and then it can also
generate a "show.html"
("kanye-west.html") for each
individual a collection

2. Identify their(the object's) responsibilities (my object is only responsible for one thing)
Artist (object)
(what is an artist responsible for?)
 - name
 - songs
 - genres

Song(object)
(what is a song responsible for?)
 - name
 - genre
 - artist
 Genre(object)
 (what is a genre responsible for?)
 - name
 - songs
 - artists
 SiteGenerator(object)
(what is a site generator responsible for?)
 - template (index.html vs show.html)
 - items in it's collection

3. Design interface

SiteGenerator.new(Artist.all, "views/artists.index.html", "_site/artists/index.html")
note: Artist.all is a dependency injection

ArtistIndexGenerator.new("views/artists.index.html", "_site/artists/index.html")

class ArtistIndexGenerator
  def initialize(template, destination)
    @artists = Artist.all
  end
end

class SiteGenerator
  def initialize(collection, template, destination)
  end
end
