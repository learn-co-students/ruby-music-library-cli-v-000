How objects collaberate?

Our program do the following:

if you have a specs it goes to the spec_helper.rb first

1. loads all of the ob into memory / it
reads all of the libraries

1a. when all of it is loaded into memory

2. then they can collaberate and interact with
each other


environment.rb file - is a place where we load all of
our dependencies(gems, data, connection to a database, actual other classes )
